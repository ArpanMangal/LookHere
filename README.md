# LookHere

App for code.fun.do

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## TODO -

1. UI improvements (add modal that loads in the beginning, describing the project and taking pdf path as input from user)
2. Allow user to 'Finish Session', after which we can see graph for overall session and some statistics summarizing the attention levels 
for entire session.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation - 

1. processFace.js: Takes an image, sends it to Microsoft Face API and returns the headPose from the response.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Possible Further Improvements :-

1. Methods to measure attention level of a group (individual is straight-forward)

2. **How the app will actually be run in practice, what the dashboard will be like,how a user can view results of previous presentations/videos.**


## Things to write in readme to be submitted :-

1. Works on Mozilla Firefox presently. Issues with Google Chrome. (Edge ??)

2. Upload file in .pdf format (Change if not so)

3. Wait for graph to load, as it takes some time to collect initial data and load the graph

4. Works for multiple faces i.e. for class.
