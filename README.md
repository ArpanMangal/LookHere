# LookHere

App for code.fun.do

Deployed Here :- 
- [Azure Website](https://lookhere.azurewebsites.net/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://arpanmangal.github.io/LookHere/)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## TODO -

1. UI improvements (~~add modal that loads in the beginning, describing the project and taking pdf path as input from user~~)
2. ~~Allow user to 'Finish Session', after which we can see graph for overall session and some statistics summarizing the attention levels for entire session.~~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Things to work on :-
1. Explore other ways of estimating attention
2. **How the app will actually be run in practice, what the dashboard will be like,how a user can view results of previous presentations/videos.**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note:- Has been tested on Firefox and Chrome. (Edge ??)
