App for code.fun.do

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## TODO -

1. Capture webcam images (running a pdf/video in parallel) and return image along with metadata (time, slide topic). 

2. Send received images to microsoft face api, and write received info (along with image metadata) on head poses to a database.

3. Analyse this data, display results in a nice UI.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Possible Further Improvements :-

1. Methods to measure attention level of a group (individual is straight-forward)

2. **How the app will actually be run in practice, what the dashboard will be like,how a user can view results of previous presentations/videos.**
